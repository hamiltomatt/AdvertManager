# AdvertManager
First-year Java project focusing on building a text-based application.

Red Fan Advertising,

I am glad you are considering to implement my advertisement prototype. In terms of security, creating an account system where only admins could log in would contribute. Another thing would be to lock off direct access to all files that could be accessed and altered with unintentionally by admins or anyone, for instance the text files or the Java files, which donâ€™t need to be altered directly.

In terms of legal considerations to take into account, the storing of user data needs to be taken. You should be making sure everything you store there is accepted by the user and have that event stored somewhere, unless serious lawsuits could come your way. Another thing would be keeping your calculations correct, as clients could get angry when they have payed the wrong price and should have payed much less.

Development risks could be minimised by ensuring backups of the program are stored on site or online. This will help you restore your data if anything goes wrong during development, such as a massive deletion of files, or are just unable to detect where an error is coming from. Implementation risks could be minimised by encapsulating different tasks as different java files or methods. This will speed up development as you will know quicker where an error has been found.

In terms of the current state of the prototype, nearly all of the features asked for are up-and-running. There is a problem with the find adverts from a specified query option, where if there is no line to search for in the while loop thats searching, it will crash. This is a very small problem that should be able to be fixed with more development time. I also hope to provide more appropriate encapsulation for options 2 and 3, which I have kept separate but share many parts.

Thank you for considering implementing my prototype and I hope we will continue to work with each other in the future.
